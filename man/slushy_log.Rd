\usage{
slushy_log(project = NULL, config = get_config(), custom = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{Character. Path to the project directory. Defaults to the root of the project.}

\item{config}{List. The configuration object retrieved from `get_config()` that includes the `pkgs` list.}

\item{custom}{Logical. If `TRUE`, runs additional diagnostics alongside the summarized report.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
The `slushy_log` function provides an overview of the package environment, 
including package usage, dependencies, and mismatches. It runs 
`renv::diagnostics` by default and can generate a custom report comparing 
library, lockfile, and package usage details.
}
\details{
This function inspects the following aspects of the package environment:
\itemize{
  \item Synchronization between the local environment and `renv` lockfile.
  \item Installed packages versus available versions in the CRAN snapshot.
  \item Top-level package usage, including those in the config file, `DESCRIPTION`, and active code.
  \item Miscellaneous packages not documented in the config or `DESCRIPTION`.
  \item Packages added or removed compared to the config file.
}
Additionally, it identifies outliers that are in use but not documented in the 
config or their dependencies.
